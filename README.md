# TaskTrackr
TaskTrackr is a desktop-based task management application built using C++ and Qt. It follows the Model-View-Programming (MVP) architecture and implements core Qt concepts such as dynamic dialogs, signal-slot communication, and modular component design.  This project is part of my learning journey in mastering real-world Qt  Applications.
